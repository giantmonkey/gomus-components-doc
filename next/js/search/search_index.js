\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nGetting started is easy and simple. All that is needed is to load the go~mus component JavaScript file and add some components to your HTML page.\nBy the end of this guide you'll have a basic understanding of how to develop with the components and how to integrate them into your website.\nStep 1. Create a basic HTML page\nCreate a HTML page with the following basic structure:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    My first go~mus components website\n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    My first go~mus components website\n  \nStep 2. Load the components script\nNext we need to load the components script into the page. To do this will simply need to define a script tag pointing to the location of the components script on the go~mus CDN. The script tag can look like this:\nWe can insert this at the end of the head section so that our HTML page now looks like the following:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    My first go~mus components website\n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n  \n    My first go~mus components website\n  \nNow when we load the page, the component script loaded in an asynchronous manner.\nStep 3. Add a component\nWe are now ready to add our first component. For this example we will add the tickets component.\nTo do this we need to add the HTML snippet for the tickets component to the body of our HTML page.\nThe snippet looks like this:\nAnd when added to our HTML page it should look like the following:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    My first go~mus components website\n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n  \n    My first go~mus components website\n    My tickets component\n    \n  \nThis time when we load the page, the component script loads and sets up the tickets component using the default settings and template.\nHooray, we have our first component! We are now able to select a desired ticket and add it to the cart.\nStep 4. Customise the component\nWe can now customise the component by providing an options JSON Object.\nLet's say we want to only display day tickets, instead of all available tickets. In this case we would provide an options object with the new types property.\n{\n  \"types\": [\"day\"]\n}We would then pass the object into the tickets component like this:\nNow when we reload our page, only day tickets will be displayed by the component.\nStep 5. Define the global configuration\nUp until now we have been using the default configuration for the components. To customise further we can define a global variable called _gomusOptions and pass in our own configuration.\nWe use this to define global options such as what go~mus intance we want the components to communicate with.\nThe default configuration that we have been using communicates to our demo go~mus instance. To change the go~mus instance to communicate with another instance we would define the following:\nvar _gomusOptions = {\n  domain: \"my.gomus.de\"\n}We can add this to our HTML page by defining it in another script tag before we load the components file.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    My first go~mus components website\n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      var _gomusOptions = {\n        domain: \"my.gomus.de\"\n      };\n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    My first go~mus components website\n    My tickets component\n    \n  \nObviously my.gomus.de doesn't exist so this will not work. To get the domain name for the instance you should work with, please contact your project manager.\n\nNOTE: The config variable needs to load first before the component script loads.\nNOTE: Detailed documentation for this variable can be found under the GomusOptions class.\n\nNext steps...\nCongratulations! You have now created your first components website.\nFor more tips and troubleshooting continue to the best practices section. Or dive straight into the top level components documentation.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/best-practices.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/best-practices.html","title":"additional-page - Best Practices","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nIf your page contains a lot of JavaScript, load the component script at end of body or make sure your page has finished rendering before loading the components.\nHide ng-template elements using cssng-template {\ndisplay: none;\n}\nProvide a loading state for components until the components script has finished loading. A gomus-components:loaded event is fired on the document when the initialisation is completed. For example:document.addEventListener('gomus-components:loaded', function () {\n console.log('loaded');\n});\n\n\nCustom tables for dynamic component parts are not possible due to strict browser rules. Flex or other css will need to be used instead.\nMake sure you have defined the global configuration to communicate with the correct go~mus instance. There are normally two for each client, a staging/test instance and a production instance. For development make sure you are using the staging environment. If you are unsure then contact your project manager.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/top-level-components.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/top-level-components.html","title":"additional-page - Top Level Components","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Level Components\n\n\n\nMain components\nDescription\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nTicketsComponent\nAllows the buying of tickets\nbeta\n\n\nProductsComponent\nAllows the buying of products (events and tours)\nbeta\n\n\nProductDetailComponent\nDisplays the details of a single product (event or tour)\nbeta\n\n\nProductListComponent\nDisplays a list of products (events and tours)\nbeta\n\n\nCartComponent\nDisplays a shopping cart\nbeta\n\n\nCartButtonComponent\nDisplays a link to the shopping cart with summary information\nbeta\n\n\nUserComponent\nAllows the logging in of and registering of users\nbeta\n\n\nUserToolbarComponent\nDisplays login and logout buttons\nbeta\n\n\nCheckoutComponent\nHandles the checkout process and displaying of checkout states\nbeta\n\n\nUserProfileComponent\nAllows the user to edit his/her profile\nplanning\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/setup-&-deployment.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/setup-&-deployment.html","title":"additional-page - Setup & Deployment","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup and Deployment\nThe setup for you test environments and you production environments should vary to enable the best experience for you and your development environment and to your end users.\nYou should always load the components script from our CDN in an asynchronous manner. For example:\nSetup for local and staging environments\nIt is important that you set the domain for the go~mus instance to a staging environment. Clients normally have two environments, a staging and production environment, and for development the staging environment should always be used.\nStaging environments can be identified by the -staging part of the domain. For example if you have a go~mus instance called my, then the production url would be my.gomus.de and the staging instance my-staging.gomus.de.\nIt is recommended that you develop against the latest version of the components using either /latest/components.min.js or /v.0/components.min.js. This means you keep up to date with the latest changes and bug fixes.\nIt is also recommended that you set the debug property in the global configuration to true. This enables the outputting of hints, warnings and errors in the browser console.\nSetup for production environments\nBefore going live you should check that you global configuration is correct.\n\nThe domain needs to be pointed to the production instance of go~mus.\nThe shop_domain needs to be set to your production website URL so that the redirects work properly.\nThe correct payment mode ids need to entered\nDebug mode should not be disabled by setting it to false, or removing it from the config completely.\nIt is recommended to use the pin the components to a specific version, or minor version if you want to receive patch updates. For example /v.1.2.3/components.min.js or /v.1.2/components.min.js.\n\nBrowser support\ngo~mus components supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers: Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and IE11 / Edge.\nThis includes the following specific versions:\n\n\n\nChrome\nFirefox\nEdge\nIE\nSafari\niOS\nAndroid\nIE Mobile\n\n\n\n\nlatest\nlatest\n14\n11\n10\n10\nNougat (7.0)/Marshmallow (6.0)\n11\n\n\n\n\n13\n10\n9\n9\nLollipop (5.0, 5.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n8\n8\nKitKat (4.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n7\nJelly Bean (4.1, 4.2, 4.3)\n-\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
